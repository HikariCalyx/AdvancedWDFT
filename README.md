# AdvancedWDFT
An advanced tool for flashing Windows Devices. Thor2 required.

I'm not satisfied with the tool made by WFun and Coolxap(MSFT Fans Circle).
They're totally limited for retail phones.
Lots of prototype Lumia phones are leaked everywhere, of course, I do have few of them.
As far as I know, prototype phones can't be flashed with the same command to a retail phone and vice versa.
And what if your phone get totally bricked with QHSUSB_DLOAD or QHSUSB_BULK?

That's why I started this project.

# Prerequisites

You have to install Windows Device Recovery Tool in order to install required driver and the core command tools.
Windows Device Recovery Tool can be downloaded here:

It only supports at least Windows 7 with Service Pack 1. And it works well with Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 too. In theory it also supports Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 or newer, but I've never tested though.

# What you need to do right now

Just compile it, analyze it and give me your idea.
Currently I'm constructing it's interface.
